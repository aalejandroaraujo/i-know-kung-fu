## ⚠️ Common Friction Points

| Module | Challenge | Alejandro’s Insight |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| 03: Declarative Agent | Grounding prompts | Use clear, scoped instructions—avoid vague intents |
| 06: Custom Agent | Connecting knowledge sources | Watch for authentication errors and unsupported formats |
| 08: Adaptive Cards | Power Fx + SharePoint | Test in isolation before embedding—debugging is brutal |
| 09: Agent Flows | Triggering backend logic | Map out flow logic visually before building |
| 11: Deployment | Publishing to Teams | Use incognito for testing—Teams caching is sneaky |

## 🧪 Alejandro’s Deployment Notes

> _“You are the eventuality of an anomaly…” — The Architect_

- ✅ Adaptive cards rendered inconsistently across channels—test in Teams and Web Chat
- 🧩 SharePoint integration required manual connector setup—document this for learners
- 🧠 Agent grounding improved dramatically with persona-based prompt design
- 🛠️ Deployment to M365 Copilot required tenant-level permissions—flag this early

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- Use visuals from [`assets/`](../assets/) to reinforce concepts
- Link to demos in [`copilot-demos/`](../copilot-demos/) (in the making...)
- Encourage learners to fork the repo and document their own anomalies 

---

## 🏁 Next Steps

- Explore [`architecture-overview.md`](architecture-overview.md) (in the making...)
- Clone a demo from [`copilot-demos/`](../copilot-demos/) (in the making...)
- Submit feedback or open a PR with your own onboarding insights
