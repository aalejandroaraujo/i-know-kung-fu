🥋 **Welcome to the dojo.**

> _“I know kung fu.” — Neo_

This repository is named after that iconic moment—not because we teach martial arts, but because of what it symbolizes: the instant transfer of skill, knowledge, and capability. That’s the promise of AI agents. That’s what this repo helps you unlock.

Whether you're a Microsoft partner, customer, trainer, or simply #EternallyCurious, this is your plug-in point to accelerated learning. Inside, you’ll find modular resources to help you master Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, Agent Framework, Power Platform, and Modern Work—through demos, playbooks, and thematic training modules.
